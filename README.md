Weather-Journal App Project
Overview
This project creates an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI weather data and date and what the user will input about feelings.

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
Prerequisites:
Node and Express should be installed on the local machine. The project file server.js should require express(), and should create an instance of their app using express.
The Express app instance should be pointed to the project folder with .html, .css, and .js files.

So you need to install in the project from the command line:  express, cors and body-parser.
The ‘cors’ package required in the project file server.js, and the instance of the app should be setup to use cors().
